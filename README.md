# IG API stock market app

**Summary**: This project consists of a python script used to interact with the IG API, enabling the user to get price data for a list of the most commonly viewed stock indices, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. 

**Functionality**: The Python script uses the urllib and requests libraries to get data from the RESTful API, manipulate this using pandas, and output to a csv format. The front end of the app is made using Electron, along with HTML and CSS styling.

**Improvement**: The login screen is currently used only to get data related to the data request, and allow the user to make multiple requests in one session. Login authentication has not been implemented and would be a furher recommended improvement.
